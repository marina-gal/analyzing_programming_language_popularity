# Analyzing Programming Language Popularity Over Time
Time-series analysis and visual exploration of programming language popularity using Python libraries (Pandas, and Matplotlib).
The goal of this analysis is to explore how the popularity of different programming languages changes over time.  
Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project compares multiple languages and visualizes long-term trends to identify which technologies are rising, stable, or declining.

This project is part of the *“100 Days of Python”* course by **Angela Yu (Udemy)**.  
It showcases practical skills in **data analysis**, **time-series exploration**, and **data visualization** using Python.

The dataset used in this project comes from **Stack Overflow**.
